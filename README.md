# Hackathon-Spring-23
== CS Course Review ==
The goal of this website is to provide a community of computer science students that are willing to help each other plan the best possible schedule for their semester, and allows students to prepare for their future classes.

== Description ==
This is a fully interactive website where UIC students can visit and review courses they've taken all in one hub.

To find a specific course simply search for it or look through the drop down menus at the top of the page. Once you’ve selected a course it will take you to a page which will display the course number, course description, and all the professors currently teaching the class. 

Once you are in the course page, there will be a bar chart which shows the average rating of the overall rating, difficulty level, and course load. We used a 1-5 scale, where 1 is the easiest, and 5 is the hardest. We calculated the average of the scores that students gave for each criteria and made a bar chart to visually represent that.

Underneath the barchart there will be a ratings form that students can fill out if they have taken the class before. The submissions will be used to calculate the values for the barcharts above it. And there will be an area for you to submit reviews about the course.

When you are submitting a review make sure the course number is a valid number, and when you are rating the class make sure it is between the values of 1 and 5.

If you navigate to the info tab you will see each member of the group and a short description of each member.
